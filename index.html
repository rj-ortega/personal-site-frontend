                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! I was born and raised in Venezuela and I came to the US when I was 14 years old. Not knowing
                    how to speak english very well, I struggled through high school. But eventually I finished it, made
                    some friends, and was actually able to picture living in the US instead of constantly wanting to go
                    back home.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The next step was to move on to college to pursue a career. It was quickly obvious that it wasn’t
                    working out, I dropped out of college after a year and I assumed that I didn’t have an aptitude for
                    Computer Science -- even though the reason I dropped out was because I never went to class and spent
                    all my time playing intramural sports, partying and playing WoW. Little did I know, Computer Science
                    was definitely the right choice, just the wrong time in my life. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I ended up working at a supermarket, I hated it, so went back to college and actually graduated this
                    time around, with a double major in Psychology and Modern Languages. I thought I was on the right
                    path… Fast forward a few years. I bounced from job to job, tried different professions, tried
                    working indoors, outdoors, full-time, seasonal jobs, even managaed to stay at a couple for almost
                    two years... But so far, I only found happiness in hobbies: video games, camping, climbing, hiking,
                    anime, travelling the world, etc.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Eventually, I stumble into coding. My brother did a career switch through a code school so after
                    trying to learn it out on my own, I decide it’s time to join a bootcamp as well and give it a real
                    shot. Now, I’ve found a passion for coding and can’t wait to keep growing professionally, keep
                    problem solving and
                    face the many challenges ahead.
